This is my first release as Mottled Moth. I did all of the songwriting, recording, and post production over the course of a few years. The most fruitful part of the experience was learning the ins and outs of post production. I've tried my hand at recording for years, tracking DIY punk and emo bands in college, but I had yet to take the time for learning proper approach to compression, equalization, etc. This was a fun first pass at applying those techniques.

The title comes from chapter 11 of Bound for Glory by Woody Guthrie, titled "Boy In Search of Something." The book documented his journey across America in search of purpose. That idea resonated with me as I grappled with how to build a life in my late twenties.

Released March 8th, 2023.
