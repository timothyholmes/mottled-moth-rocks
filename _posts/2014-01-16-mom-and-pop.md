Jerry's stand-up*: [I like the names they have for cars.] Like, no baron has ever owned a LeBaron. Or the Ford LTD. "LTD." Limited. It's a "limited" edition...what did they make, fifty million of those? "Yes, it's 'limited' to the number we can sell." Or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name, you know how they'll do that? The "Integra." Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The "Supra." Or the "Impreza." Yeah? Well, I hope it's not a "lemona"...or you'll be hearing from my "lawya."

*Due to an incomplete video transfer, the dialogue above [in brackets] has been filled in by the transcriber of the script (me, in other words).


Opening scene - George looking at cars at a used car lot, checking out an '89 Volvo.

CAR SALESMAN: George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?

GEORGE: I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.

SALESMAN: I got a LeBaron convertible right here.

GEORGE (chuckles): N.I. Not interested.

SALESMAN: It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.

GEORGE (suddenly interested): Jon Voight?


New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.

JERRY: Okay, Tim. You're welcome. *Hangs up.*

ELAINE: Was that Tim Whatley?

JERRY: Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. *Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.* You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?

ELAINE: I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? *Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.*

JERRY: Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.

ELAINE: Why?

JERRY: He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. *Mimics brushing his teeth* Away from the gums... *The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.*

JERRY: Uh - new car!

ELAINE: Ohhh! 

JERRY: Hey! Did you get the Volvo?

GEORGE: No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.

ELAINE: A LeBaron?

JERRY: I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.

GEORGE: What Consumer? I'm the consumer.

JERRY: Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.

GEORGE: Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.

ELAINE: Jon Voight? The actor?

GEORGE (boasting): That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.

JERRY: You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?

GEORGE (defensive): No, no...

JERRY: I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.

GEORGE: Alright, maybe I do. So what.

ELAINE: I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. *Kramer enters.*

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.

ELAINE: I like coffee.

GEORGE: I like "cookies."

KRAMER: Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.

GEORGE: Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.

KRAMER: Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'

JERRY: I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.

KRAMER: Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.

JERRY: Alright, take 'em.

KRAMER (happily): Yeah-yah.
