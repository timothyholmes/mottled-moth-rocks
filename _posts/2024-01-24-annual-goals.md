I spin my tires without a good plan. The past two years have been great for nurturing creativity in my personal life. I'm shooting for more of that this year, with wider focus than just working on music.

1. ✅ 75 medium challenge January - March
2. ✅ Upload Mottled Moth split with Matt
3. ✅ Make a personal website, with a blog
4. ✅ Sweet Understanding by Mottled Moth
5. ❌ Publish a photo zine
    * This just didn't make sense to prioritize as I started working through things
6. ✅ Become a better chef
7. 🟠 Take 4 hikes
8. ✅ Visit 2 friends out of state 
9. ❌ Learn a roller skating trick
9. 🟠 Complete a language course in Bulgarian.
    * Starting out the year with 28% left on [Bulgaro.io](http://bulgaro.io)
10. ✅ Fix a broken guitar
11. ✅ Reading Bingo 2024
12. ✅ Try more new restaurants
13. ❌ Make a garbage pickup system for walks

Key/Scoring
* ✅ = Done, 2 points
* 🟠 = Made good progress, 1 points
* ❌ = Failed, 0 points

76% completion rate, not bad but would like to improve in 2025.
