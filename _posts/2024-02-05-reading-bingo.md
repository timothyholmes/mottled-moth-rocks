Last year I started what I hope becomes a long running annual tradition, Reading Bingo. The rules are simple, each square can be crossed off with a book you finished during the calendar year of the game. A book can only be used for a single square, despite the fact that it may meet the criteria for multiple squares. For each square you get a point, and for each “bingo” you get a bonus point. Bingos which garner extra points are:
* any rows or columns made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
* Four corners
* A full board blackout

Last year’s champion was my lovely wife, with a whopping 26 points. For her struggles, she was awarded the coveted Reading Bingo Cup. Feelings of avarice abounded when she received the major award ([on Christmas Day no less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNyqYeIyOUc)) and competition for this year is already heating up!

[A PDF of the boards is available for anyone that wants to play along](/assets/docs/reading-bingo-2024.pdf "Download reading bingo boards"). I highly recommend finding some like minded friends or family with which to make a league. If anyone needs a book for "read a book from someone's board last year" you can find all of my 2023 reads [here on Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103225612?shelf=2023) Happy reading!
