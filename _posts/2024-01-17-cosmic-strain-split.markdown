Last summer, Matt and I kicked around the idea of doing a split release for some songs that we'd been writing. We worked on them in our respective apartments over the back half of 2023, and I'm quite pleased with the results. As always Matt's song writing chops blow me away, and his lastest effort as Cosmis Strain is no different. The album art is two stacked polaroids taken at my wedding.

Released January 21, 2024.
