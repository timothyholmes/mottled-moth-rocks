My goal completion rate in 2025 declined a bit from the previous year, [clocking in at 60% down from 75% in 2024.](/annual/2025/02/12/annual-goals.html). The ones that slipped were The Grownd Proulers EP and launching an application outside of my job. 

I think there were _legitimate_ reasons that these stalled, such as a lack of market fit for the app I was developing and external collaborators dragging their feet. While I'm not necessarily happy with the outcomes, from failure comes lessons which help me approach new challenges. I've made some progress on them both, pivoting on app ideas for something that has a clearly defined purpose and re-staffing the EP's contributors.

1. 60 Day Reset
    * A collection of daily routines concerning fitness, mental health, and creativity to be done consistently at the start of the year.
2. Grow Cosmic Strain
    * With a new EP, a new practice spot geared toward refinement of our sound, and plenty of shows under our belt, there's a lot of potential here. This needs refinement on **how**, but essentially should result in new music, media, and a larger fanbase.
3. Mottled Moth presents The Grownd Proulers EP
    * Still working on it and it will be done!!! I have too much nostalgia and joy in these recordings to let them languish.
4. Launch an application outside of my job
    * Looking to ship an app for tracking [Reading Bingo](/lore/2026/reading-bingo.html) and continue development on another idea to codify [The Path.](/system/2024/02/02/the-path.html)

Happy searching to my fellow goal setters and good luck on your respective journeys. Persistence reveals the path!
