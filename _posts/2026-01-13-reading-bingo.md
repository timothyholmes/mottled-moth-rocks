[We wrapped our third Reading Bingo](/lore/2025/02/18/reading-bingo.html) at Christmas this year. My sister Jessie took home the hardware with a whopping 80 points, two boards fully completed!

I have a few different flavors available this year. One is what we're using in our family league, which were made special by having each of our three former champions contribute a square. I've also included a generic board, and a kid's version. The latter was inspired by my niece, who has been blowing through the Princess in Black series. If my reading can inspire her to keep her nose in books, I'll consider my time on Earth well spent.

Download list:
* [Family Board](/assets/docs/family-reading-bingo-2026.pdf "Download family boards here")
* [Generic Board](/assets/docs/generic-reading-bingo-2026.pdf "Download generic boards here")
* [Kid's League](/assets/docs/kids-reading-bingo-2026.pdf "Download kids boards here")

The rules are the same as always. Read a book that fits the description on a square to mark it off. You get 1 point for:

* A square
* A row, column, or diagonal
* Four corners
* Full board blackout (+2, so that a full board is 40 points)

If you complete a full board, you can restart with a new board from any year.

I recommend finding a group of friends to make a league! [Please let me know](/contact/) if you enjoy the idea so I can include it in next year's blog post. :^)

### P.S.

I read 19 books last year, the list is available on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103225612-timothy-holmes?shelf=2025). It was a light year, I felt myself losing steam near the end of summer so I decided to give my system a shock and start Infinite Jest, which took me a good four months to get through. Not pictured here, since I finished it in January.

My two favorites this year were Babel by R.F. Kuang and Horse by Geraldine Brooks. I highly recommend both.

This year I feel the need to say something about the books I did not like. [North Woods by Daniel Mason SUCKS](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6928535059), it was vapid and overhyped beyond reason. I also re-read Catch-22, marked as one of the few books I found genuinely funny just a few years ago, but found it flat and unfunny. I still chuckled at times, but re-reading certainly demoted it from my favorites shelf.
