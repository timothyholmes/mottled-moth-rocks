I had a lot of fun writing this one. I think music is best when there are fewer things going on, but everything moves together in a way that works. I limited my guitars to a lead and rhythm (single tracked), and a keyboard to fill out the rest of the mid section rather than double tracking rhythm guitars.

I also spent a lot of time dialing in the production here, and felt satisfied with the end result. I try not to do too much in post, mainly balancing EQs and giving just enough compression to tighten things up, and that strategy remained but I used a few new techniques to color the vocals. I learned these from [Raffer](https://www.rafferprod.com/raffermusic) who is HIGHLY worth a follow on Instagram if you enjoy home production.

The lyrics speak to duality - I wrote this from the perspective of the idealized self, the person one aspires to be, speaking to the reality that often fails to live up to those ambitions. The longer I live, the more I understand that this is a battle that will never end.

Buy it on bandcamp or give me a few streams to support!

Released February 6, 2026.
