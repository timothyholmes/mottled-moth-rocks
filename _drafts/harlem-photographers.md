I recently read Colson Whitehead’s novel Harlem Shuffle. Whitehead is an absolute master of his craft. His debut, The Intuitionist, was sharp and original. He put on an alternative history clinic with 2016’s The Underground Railroad, and The Nickel Boys was put on my all time favorites shelf without hesitation. One aspect of his novels I thoroughly enjoy is how he intertwines reality and fiction into one seamless narrative. I had no idea that the development of Central Park caused a primarily black settlement, Seneca Village, to be entirely destroyed and its people to be displaced through eminent domain. The generational wealth lost by these families is unfathomable, in a city where some of America’s most storied white families were able to ride the wave of rising property values to prosperity and influence just a few streets over. Ray Carney, the protagonist of Harlem Shuffle, ruminates over this fact and frames it against his experience in 1960s Harlem. Through fictional eyes, the reality of our world becomes a bit clearer to the reader.

In the second act of Harlem Shuffle, one of Ray’s accomplices named Zippo laments over his career trajectory as a photographer. Aspirations of being a “great chronicler” of Harlem Life dashed in favor of petty capers in the neighborhood. He names two of the chroniclers whose legacy made an impression on him, Van Der Zee and Carl Van Vechten. Unfamiliar with both of their names, I began to research.

This roman à clef became an instant bestseller and served as an informal guide book to Harlem. It also split the Black literary community, as some including Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen appreciated it, while others like Countee Cullen and W. E. B. Du Bois regarded it as an "affront to the hospitality of black folks". The book fuelled a period of "Harlemania", during which the neighborhood became en vogue among white people, who then frequented its cabarets and bars.
