I started playing guitar around 2003, plucking out Green Day songs on a Takamine acoustic. My first electric was a Fender Stratocaster in sunburst I got a year later. Electric guitar was my weapon against reality, early on I began taking my meager skills to play in bands. My friend's dad played guitar and loved when we cranked up our solid state combos in their house. He had a bunch of gear, an old Gibson Les Paul special, a tube Peavy amp, and a handful of overdrive and distrotion pedals. Trying out new gear was a relvelation to me, as swapping one guitar for another or combining pedals in some strange way could completely transform the sound of the nickel wound strings in drastically different ways.

In high school I played mostly in worship bands affiliated with a local Pentecostal outfit. This introduced me to a new type of guitar playing, one that relayed on well timed delay pedals and dreamy choruses to create a sound rather than the drive dependent riffs of my childhood. The older guys in these bands guided my contemporaries and I through a sea of boss stompboxes and obscure boutique pedals that powered their sound. It was here I realized the power and wonderful tone found in simple tube amps, mostly of the Fender variety.

After walking away from the church scene, for various reasons unrelated to guitar, I started playing in DIY bands. After spending some time behind the drum kit, I started playing guitar in Drawback. I desperately wanted to combine my tonal history in this band using heavy distorted sounds along side crisp modulation to create a textured wall of sound.

Today, I write and record guitar for Mottled Moth. My goal hear tone wise is similar to Drawback, but the focus is overall less on the guitar and more about song writing as a whole. I'm following Adam Granduciel and Kurt Vile's footsteps here, while pushing it towards the more distorted sounds I love from Green Day and Descendents.

In addition to Mottled Moth, I play in Cosmic Strain, a shoegaze group started by my friend Matt Cole. The tone of this band is ideally heavy, with different layers of distortion available to create different stages of impact throughout songs. The dreamy hallmarks of shoegaze are ever present, with chorus and reverb ever present.

## Cosmic Strain

To achieve this sound, I run my Fender Mustang through a pedalboard and into a Fender Deville 4x10. My pedal board starts with a volume pedal, currently an Ernie Ball VP JR with a built in tuner. From there I run my drive pedals through the fx loop. I stage the drives so that they can layer with each other to create a myriad of different tones. First there's a compressor for a lead boost, a light overdrive (Soul Food or Old Yeller), a mid range distrotion (SL Drive), and a thick distortion with a lot of bottom end (Big Muff Pi.) The volume pedal can control the drives completely in this setup, so pulling back on the volume pedal keeps any humming from buzzing through a live set. After the volume comes modulation, an MXR chorus and then two delay pedals. The first delay is typically a mid effect level and shorter feedback with a tap tempo, I use the DD-7 for this. The second delay is a Japanese DD-5, which static timing, long feedback and low effect level. This allows it to act somewhat like a freeze pedal, it can be turned on when holding a tone to extend it for as long as the pedal is on. I combine this with volume swells to create a cloud of harmonized tones.
