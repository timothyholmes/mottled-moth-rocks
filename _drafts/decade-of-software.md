## Internship

It's hard to believe I've been building software for a decade. I left college with a tenuous at best grasp on how to program, spending most of my time honing skills that ultimately did not interest me. Outside of a few odd jobs, I didn't get any experience on the web until my first internship.

I worked at a fledging company that was building tools for safer policing. After getting manufacturing off the ground for their hardware product, they brought a lone software development intern on board to develope POCs for their real time tracking software. I worked in a small windowless room that held a few shelves of electronic components and my desk. I had a trusty dell laptop with an external monitor, a box full of GPS units, and a coffee cup.

My web skills at the time were limited to HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP. There was little to no direct guidance on how I should go about my tasks, so I started with what I knew and expanded as needed. I built my first app my cobbling together an AngularJS front end supported by a PHP and MySQL backend. The GPS units connected to a Python socket server that dumped all of the data into a database, and the frontend polled the backend every half second to refresh the mapping software. I was beligerently happy after I returned from a taste drive with my GPS and the application worked, plotting my path in real time. The implementation was nothing I'd be able to get it away with today, but it was wonderfully naive and a great foray into web applications.

## Gets Real

I got my next job after graduating at a medium sized operation downtown. It was an entry level software developer positionn the frontend team of a real estate website. I joined my buddy Corey on the team and we cranked out the first version of a complete rewrite of the site, from a ColdFusion stack to an AngularJS frontend that targeted a NodeJS backend. The end result was a modern looking site that was significantly faster to load. The opportunity arose at the end of this project to try out backend programming, something I was growing more interested in at the time, so I gave it a shot.

Backend programming is in my opinion where the heart of a modern application lives. All the business logic is here, the data that makes each experience personal, and it orchestrates the events required for a good experience to feel like magic. The existing backend devs were sharp as tacks, so I soaked up all the game I could from them. We built a solid micro-service architecture to power the site and mobile apps.... 

I made a ton of friends at this job. Our happy hours were the stuff of legend, and they definitely made all the crazy times worth it. Shoutout to Mike, Corey, Tucker, Paulo, Mike Sr, Eugene, Jullian, Derek, and all the other wonderful souls that made up this office.

This was also my first experience with remote work, as I split my time between Norfolk and Richmond near the end of my tenure. This was one of the main reasons I started looking for something local to Richmond, as I had yet to develop the time management skills needed to be productive remotely.

## Big Business

I wanted to try something new after a few years into my first role, so I joined one of the local big-corps that was position themselves as a tech-first organization. My team was a small scrum team nestled in the typical corproate structure within a larger department, which rolled up to a line of business helmed by an executive, which rolled up to... the picture paints itself.

This job was pretty non-invasive to my life in a wonderful way. It was very 9 to 5 oriented, aside from the occasional late night deployment. The work life balance was ultimately my favorite part, I went on a ton of walks during my lunches and read plenty of books as I enjoyed salad or pizza from the cafeteria. 

The tech role was similar fare to my previous. I made a lot of NodeJS services with Hapi, maintained a handful of legacy projects in tech stacks with which I had no experience, and made the occassional foray into our frontend Vue code. The platform was geared towards internal users, so the scale was considerably less than my previous role which was consumer facing. In turn, we had no real need to setup anything particularly complex for the vast majority of our use cases and after a while I felt like I was growing stagnant with my skills.

My team at this job rocked, and we had a lot of fun together. Many of us played music so a few nights saw us in a garage with a few guitars and a drum kit. We went on a few trips together to visit different offices and always had a good time.

During my time here I volunteered with [Microsoft's TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals) program through [CodeVA](https://codevirginia.org). I partnered with 2 other software developers and we taught a basic programming course to a high school in Virginia. We spent a semester going through the building blocks of programming: variables, boolean logic, conditionals, etc. with a visual language called SNAP. We taught our classes remotely, but a few times we made the drive out to the county to participate in the classroom. I tried my best to encourage those that were really interested to try their hand at programming, and framed things as best I could as to how it would relate to their interests. Near the end of our time together, we organized a field trip to our office and showed them what a day in the life of a dev looks like.
