# Overview

In this series' preceding posts I covered the strategies I use to drive consistent behaviors in areas that aid my self fulfillment. Identifying the actions that lead to fulfillment is by no means an easy task, yet it is the crucial starting point for performing worthwhile actions. Once your virtues have been identified and you understand the techniques to perform consistent action towards overarching goals, the process can be applied to your discrete application. This is how I choose to apply these lessons.

## The First of the Month

Research updates the start of a time period is a helpful mental framing that makes things more likely to stick. Think New Year's Resolutions. Review your virtues for the next steps.

Virtues for reference:
* Creativity - develop ideas and implement them
* Knowledge - expand understanding
* Fitness - have a balanced diet and stay physically active
* Network - nurturing relationships
* Spirit - manage mental health
* Home - build a happy home
* Lore - craft a repository of media that enhances understanding of the human condition

Identify a project or two you'd like to progress during the coming month. Come up with a single step, realistically achievable in the next month, to complete. For this example, I'll use my current Mottled Moth project. From where I am right now, my next step is to finish writing lyrics for my next batch of 5 songs. Schedule a session to do the work for this goal. I'll schedule mine for once a week, every Thursday.

Establish routine lists. These require some initial setup, but once they exist you can use the same ones every day/week/month. On subsequent months, I'd just take a few minutes to review my routines and make sure they align with how I want to live.

Daily
* Meditate - spirit
* Cook dinner or do the dishes - home
* Take out the trash - home
* Exercise for 45 minutes - fitness
* Don't smoke a cigarette = fitness

Weekly
* Clean a bathroom - home
* Play 3 chess games - knowledge
* Check-in with a friend - network
* Listen to a new album - lore
* Write a journal entry - spirit

Monthly
* Watch a movie - lore
* Finish a book - lore
* Demo a song - creativity

## Daily

Check off your daily routines, review completion rate at the end of each day. Great time to do a gratitude log, 3 things you're grateful for and what the intention is for the next day.

## Weekly, every Sunday

Review any notes created during the last week. Check in on how well you completed your daily and weekly routines, and schedule some time to complete one or two of the monthly ones before the next weekly review.

## The End of the month

Review how the past month went, and repeat the cycle.

# Summary

* Ton of books / TV / Movies
