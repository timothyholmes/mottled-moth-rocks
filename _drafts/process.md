# Overview

In this series' preceding posts I covered the strategies I use to drive consistent behaviors in areas that aid my self fulfillment. Identifying the actions that lead to fulfillment is by no means an easy task, yet it is the crucial starting point for performing worthwhile actions. Once your virtues have been identified and you understand the techniques to perform consistent action towards overarching goals, such as [sessions, routines, and retrospectives](/system/2024/03/27/keeping-time.html), the process can be applied for discrete application.

## The First of the Year

I choose to start my goal setting at the start of the New Year. The annual turning of the calendar offers a natural time every year to take stock of life and reevaluate direction. At this point I select a few projects and overarching goals to work on throughout the year, using [my virtues](/system/2024/08/14/virtues.html) to guide the selections. As always, start small and select a reasonable number of items to be done. There're few things that knock one off track with as much efficiency as trying to do too much.

I set [goals for 2024](/annual/2024/01/24/annual-goals.html) in this fashion. Here's a subset of my goals set for the year:
* Releasing a new batch of Mottled Moth songs
* Visiting friends out of state
* Developing a website
* Improve my culinary skills

## The First of the Month

Identify a project or two you'd like to progress during the coming month. Come up with a single step, realistically achievable in the next month, to complete. For this example, I'll use my current Mottled Moth project. In my current state, my next step is to finish writing lyrics for my next batch of 5 songs. I'll schedule a session for once a week, every Thursday, to work towards completing this stage of the project.

Some goals are more passive, and are developed through smaller habits rather than dedicated session time. For these I establish routine lists for different timeframes. These require some initial setup, but once they exist you can use the same ones every day/week/month. On subsequent months, I'd just take a few minutes to review my routines and make sure they align with how I want to live.

My routines look something like this:

Daily
* Meditate - spirit
* Read 10 pages - lore
* Cook dinner or do the dishes - home
* Take out the trash - home
* Exercise for 45 minutes - fitness
* Don't smoke a cigarette - fitness

Weekly
* Clean a bathroom - home
* Play 3 chess games - knowledge
* Check-in with a friend - network
* Listen to a new album - lore
* Write a journal entry - spirit

Monthly
* Watch a movie - lore
* Demo a song - creativity

## Daily

Throughout the day, check off routines you've completed. Prioritize knocking out daily tasks and scheduled sessions. 

In the evening, take some time to review how many daily routines were completed. Do this at the same time every day to establish a ritual. I take a minute to do a short gratitude journal at the end of the day when I do this, and set an intention for the day to come.

## Weekly

Review any notes created during the last week. Check in on how well you completed your daily and weekly routines, and schedule some time to complete one or two of the monthly ones before the next weekly review.

## The End of the month

Review how the past month went, and repeat the cycle.

# Summary

I've been doing this for a few years now, and have accomplished much with it. 

* Read ~23 books a year
* Dropped 25lbs
* Released 2 projects as Mottled Moth
* Deployed a ton of great code
