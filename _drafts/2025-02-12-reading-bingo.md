Last year's [Reading Bingo](/lore/2024/02/05/reading-bingo.html) was a success! I play with two leagues, one for my wife's family and one for my own. This year Dzhuliyana brought home the hardware for the former, and my sister-in-law Hanna won gold in the latter.

Boards for this year are available [here](). The objective is to read a book that fits the description on a square to mark it off. You get 1 point for:

* A square
* A row, column, or diagonal
* Four corners
* Full board blackout

I recommend finding a group of friends to make league! [Please let me know](/contact/) if you enjoy the idea so I can include it in next year's blog post. :^)

#### P.S.

I read 42 books last year, the list is available on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103225612-timothy-holmes?shelf=2024). A few of my favorites were:

* The Maniac - an astounding meditation on technology, past present and future
* Yellowface - A hilarious lampoon of cultural appropriation
* Hyperion - A sci-fi classic up there with the likes of Dune and Foundation, with a really interesting take on interstellar travel and empire building
