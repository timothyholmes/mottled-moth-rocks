## Inspiration

For the past few years, my wife and I have started the year with a little challenge. We were inspired by [75 hard](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info), which is ridiculous but not without merit. The gist is that 75 days straight, execute a few habits daily: excercise twice, eat within the guidelines of a dietary plan, avoid alcohol, drink 140 fl oz of water, and read some amount of a non-fiction book. Missing a day causes the timer to reset. 

The good things about it are that it fosters consistency, focuses on nutrition, and staying active. The bad things are that the bar is set unneccessarily high in nearly every category, and reseting the clock when a single day is not effective demotivating for the vast majority of people. We approached it a bit more generically, creating a list of habits for ourselves to do every day and having a clear date. I decided to create a simple scoring system to gauge how well performed the challenge, a fully done day is 2 points, doing some of the activities is 1, and nothing is 0. The scoring for 70 days done fully,  4 done halfway, and 1 missed completey would be (2(70) + 4) = 144 total points. Divided by the total number of possible points, 2 * 75 = 150, the completion rate is 96%.

This year my list of activites was:
* weigh in
* excercise
* eat within a calorie budget
* drink 80 oz of water
* read 10 pages of a book (fiction is just as valuable, if not more, than non-fiction)
* don't get drunk
* don't smoke weed
