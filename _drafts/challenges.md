## Inspiration

For the past few years, my wife and I have started the year with a little challenge. We were inspired by [75 hard](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info), which is ridiculous but not without merit. The gist is that 75 days straight, execute a few habits daily: excercise twice, eat within the guidelines of a dietary plan, avoid alcohol, drink 140 fl oz of water, and read some amount of a non-fiction book. Missing a day causes the timer to reset.

The good things about it are that it fosters consistency, focuses on nutrition, and staying active. The bad things are that the bar is set unneccessarily high in nearly every category, and reseting the clock when a single day is  demotivating for the vast majority of people. We approached it a bit more generically, creating a list of habits for ourselves to do every day and having a clear date.

## Framework

This got me thinking about how a general challenge framework would look in the context of my [routine system.](/system/2024/03/27/keeping-time.html) I've noticed that focusing on a subset of daily routines typically increases how well I lock into tasks overall. One of my most productive times of the year is generally when we try our 75 day challenge. Since the challenge offers a bit of novelity and a nearby target, it draws my attention to it. Research states that habits take about 2 to 5 months to form and that regular repetition significantly strengthens habit automaticity, so giving specific habits attention for a set amounth of time allows someone to focus on integrating those routines into their daily life. Once that happens for the duration of the challenge, chances are the habit has a solid foundation for it to be able to continue well after the challenge is completed.

If this sounds insanely ardous to track and maintain - you're not wrong. However I'm an unyielding tinkerer, and I have a robust set of tools on my phone that make the setting up a challenge and tracking progress incredibly easy. The only thing I have to think about on a daily basis is marking my items as completed in the reminders app. I use this as a tool for scheduling nearly everything in my life, so I'm already looking at it constantly throughout the day.

## Application

This year the activies I focused on were:
1. Weigh in
1. Excercise 45 minutes - including strength training thrice a week.
1. Meditate
1. Eat within a calorie budget
1. Drink 80 oz of water
1. Practice guitar
1. Crack a book (fiction is just as valuable, if not more, than non-fiction)
1. Don't get drunk
1. Don't smoke weed

I decided to create a simple scoring system to gauge how well we performed the challenge, a fully done day is 2 points, doing some of the activities is 1, and nothing is 0. The scoring for 70 days done fully,  4 done halfway, and 1 missed completey would be (2(70) + 4) = 144 total points. Divided by the total number of possible points, 2 * 75 = 150, the completion rate is 96%.

This scoring system, rather than reseting the entire challenge when one component is missed, allows the challenger to make smart decisions about when to cut themselves some slack and enjoy life.

## Outcomes

The past few years my challenges have gone extremely well. In 2024 I shed about 25lb, rode over 1000 miles on my bike, and knocked out 42 books. In 2025 I worked on strength exercises and learned a ton about my diet, reallocating my macros for a proper distribution to support my overall energy and health. All of these wins came from consistent habits built during my start-of-the-year challenge. The most amazing outcome of this to me is that these habits _stuck_ for years afterwards.

This year I've focused most of my efforts on building habits in the gym. We're about a third of the way through, and I've worked through 2 weeks of a beginner lifting program that I'm really enjoying. I'm working on my 5th book, and I've learned a bunch of strange new chord voicings on the guitar.
