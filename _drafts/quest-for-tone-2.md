I wrote a post a while back about [my guitar rig over the years.](/creativity/2025/01/24/guitar-gear.html) The evolving sound of [Cosmic Strain](https://cosmicstrain.band) has pushed tone in different directions.

The first change was a change in order. I moved my MXR Analog chorus after my delays, so that I could get some shimmer on my short delay from the DD-7 and the long tail from the DD-3. From there, I added a new flanger pedal, the EHX Stereo Electric Mistress, for an additional layer of texture. Having it at the end of the chain gave the option for using stereo outputs, so I sent the main out to my amp and the second output to my UA Dream pedal that I've been using as an amp replacement for at-home recordings.

The UA Dream is a fantastic pedal. For recording it does the job of recreating an old Fender tube amp perfectly, and for my Mottled Moth recordings I run my pedalboard and the Dream directly into my audio interfece. It takes some tinkering to get the right cab for your sound, and honestly 60% of them don't sound too great, but when you find the right one it is a great replacement for an amp while recording or having quiet practice.

With the UA Dream now on my pedalboard, I started using it regularly. A Walrus Audio Canvas DI box sits at the end of the chain for easily getting good signal from the board to front of house. Paired with my Hot Rod Deville, it can easily augment a great amp sound by giving more low or high end, depending on what is missing from the amps sound in a live environment.

Future improvements are to add an amp switcher that will allow me to stop the signal for one amp channel at a time. This would be great for changing energy levels during songs, engaging just half of the output for lighter moments and engaging both fo a full on blast of sound.
