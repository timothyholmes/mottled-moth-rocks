DIY musician and professional programmer. This blog is a collection of notes, thoughts, and lessons learned while walking the path of self fulfillment. The tools of self fulfillment are many; I enjoy reading, riding bikes, taking photos, and playing chess amongst other things. I intentionally set goals on a yearly basis and document my progress here. 

Mottled Moth is a pseudonym I use to publish music I write and record by myself. The style aspires to take the sounds of my most lasting influences and make something that people can tap their toes to. The bands that have really stuck with me are Green Day, The War on Drugs, and Waxahatchee.
